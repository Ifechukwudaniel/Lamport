# Lamport-language 

The Lamport programming language offers users the flexibility to choose between interpretation and compilation for their code, each option differing in terms of types and syntax. Additionally, I am working on implementing Lamport in both Rust and Go, aiming to conduct a benchmark to determine the superior option. It's important to note that Lamport is primarily designed for educational purposes rather than serving as a fully-fledged compiler.
